# notepad-clone-java-swing-awt
This project is a Java-based desktop text editor built using Core Java, Swing, and AWT, inspired by the classic Notepad application. It provides a clean, menu-driven graphical interface that allows users to efficiently create, open, edit, save, and print text files.
The application includes essential text-editing features such as New, Open, Save, Save As, Print, and an integrated Find and Replace option to improve usability. Swing is used for building the user interface, while AWT handles event-driven interactions and layout management.
This project demonstrates practical implementation of Java GUI development, file handling, and event-driven architecture, and reflects my ability to design and build a complete desktop application using core Java technologies.
